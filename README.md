# PiPot (Micro Honeypot for RPi) - Main repository

PiPot (Micro Honeypot for RPi) is a flexible honeypot for (industrial) 
environments that runs on a Raspberry Pi. It was developed by Willem Van 
Iseghem for the Master thesis at the 
[Fachhochschule St. PÃ¶lten](https://www.fhstp.ac.at/) in 2016. [Limes Security
GmbH](https://www.limessecurity.com) sponsored the thesis by providing the 
necessary hardware.

This repository is meant for centralizing issues and enhancement proposals, as
well as documentation on how to install and run PiPot.
